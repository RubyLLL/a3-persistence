## Your Web Application Title

your glitch (or alternative server) link e.g. http://a3-charlie-roberts.glitch.me

Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- 
- The biggest challenge I faced is to 
- I chose local strategy for authentication. The main reason is that registering and logging in via an email and password are quite intuitive for me, and it also makes storing and organizing user info in database quite easy.
- I used Bootstrap for my CSS framework since it is the one I am most familiar with. I did not make much custom CSS styling beyond that.
- Passport.js: controls registration and log in.
- session: session middleware can change req.user to currently logged in user; this allows us to check users' identities before letting them access certain routes.
- connext-flash: I use it to display success and error messages to give users clear feedback on their input.
- body parser: parse req.body so that we can access it.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I used OAuth authentication via the GitHub strategy
- **Tech Achievement 2**: In the project, I uses the following express middleware: Passport.js, body parser, session, flash, and helmet.
- **Tech Achievement 3**In addition to OAuth strategies, I also use EJS for this project. EJS allows developers to display dynamically-created content on the website directly, in my case, I use it to display success and error messages, which provides users clear feedback on their input. Though EJS has a learning curve, overall it makes writing frontend code easier than merely relying on HTML/JavaScript.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements

- Ensure that interactive elements are easy to identify
- Provide clear and consistent navigation options
- Ensure that form elements include clearly associated labels
- Provide easily identifiable feedback
- Create designs for different viewport sizes
- Associate a label with every form control
- Identify page language and language changes
